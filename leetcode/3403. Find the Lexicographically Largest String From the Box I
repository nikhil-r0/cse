word = "zxabc"
numFriends = 2

z xabc
zx abc
zxa bc
zxab c
here zxab is the answer, and according to the approach I suggested, first 
	maxlen = len of string - numFriends + 1
	maxlen = 5 - 2 + 1
	maxlen = 4
	
so then find the letter last in the order alphabetically
that would be z.
Now get the maximum split from z with len <= maxlen
thats zxab the answer.

word = "aaabac"
numFriends = 3

a a abac
aa a bac
aaa b ac
aaab a c
a aa bac
a aab ac
a aaba c

clearly the largest lexalogically is c (I am not sure, might be wrong)
SO here after calculating 
	maxlen = 6 - 3 + 1
	maxlen = 4
Now find the largest letter, which is c
Now get the largest split from c with len <= maxlen
which is still c, so this is probably the answer
